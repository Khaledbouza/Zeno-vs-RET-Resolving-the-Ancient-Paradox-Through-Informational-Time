# Zeno-vs-RET-Resolving-the-Ancient-Paradox-Through-Informational-Time
This project visualizes and explains how Recursive Entropic Time (RET) provides a modern, computational resolution to Zeno's paradox of motion.

It includes:

- 🧠 A full article comparing RET with classical and modern theories
- 🧮 A Python visualization comparing RET-based motion vs. classical halving
- 📚 Philosophical and physical implications

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- matplotlib
- numpy

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Run the Visualization

python zeno_vs_ret.py
