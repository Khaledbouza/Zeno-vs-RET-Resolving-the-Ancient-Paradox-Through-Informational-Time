# Zeno-vs-RET-Resolving-the-Ancient-Paradox-Through-Informational-Time


## Overview

This project provides a modern computational resolution to one of the oldest philosophical puzzles in history—**Zeno’s paradox of motion**—through a novel temporal framework known as *Recursive Entropic Time (RET)*.

Zeno argued that motion is impossible because any journey can be divided into an infinite number of steps. While calculus shows that the sum of these steps converges, the paradox lingers conceptually:  
If each step is frozen in stillness, how does motion ever truly begin?


*RET answers this* by redefining time itself—not as a continuous background, but as a state-dependent, information-driven process. In RET, motion arises not from accumulating still moments, but from *discrete, recursive ticks* triggered by internal structural changes in a system.

## What This Project Contains

-  **article.md** – A full-length article contrasting RET with other top explanatory models of Zeno’s paradox, including classical calculus, quantum discreteness, and process philosophy.
- **zeno_vs_ret.py** – A Python script that visually compares Zeno's classical halving logic with RET-style progression using a recursive, complexity-based time model.
-  **requirements.txt** – A list of required Python libraries to run the visualization.
-  **LICENSE** – MIT License for open-source reuse.

##  How It Resolves Zeno's Paradox

| Classical View | RET Framework |
|----------------|----------------|
| Time is a continuous coordinate | Time is a discrete, emergent process |
| Motion = sum of infinitely many smaller steps | Motion = causal tick from structural change |
| Zeno’s arrow is always approaching its target | RET arrow reaches the target after finite ticks |

In RET, there is no infinite slicing. Each “tick” of time occurs when the system has earned its next step by undergoing a meaningful informational change. This *recursively generated flow of time* avoids the paradox altogether.
